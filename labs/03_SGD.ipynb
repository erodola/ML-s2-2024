These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say 32-512 data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation.\n","\n","Nevertheless, the optimal size of a mini-batch is still debated and many interesting works have been published in the last years, for instance:\n","\n","- [*Don't Decay the Learning Rate, Increase the Batch Size*](https://ar5iv.org/abs/1711.00489)\n","- [*Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Evaluation\n","\n","We are not done yet, because we still need to evaluate the performance of our trained model on the validation set."],"metadata":{"id":"0Fk09CLmr7u5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["> **EXERCISE:** Test your SGD-trained model on the validation set of the small digit data.
